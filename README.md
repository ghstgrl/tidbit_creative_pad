# tidbit_creative_pad
Macropad built for blender/illustrator/procreate shortcuts

Files are based on  QMK files provided by u/way_out_west on Reddit. [Layout is based on their Tidbit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/tifvxr/built_a_tidbit_macropad_for_procreate_super_fun/).

[nullbitsco provided keymaps were referenced for the edits.](https://github.com/nullbitsco/tidbit/tree/master/keymaps)

The Keymap.c was updated to reflect the additon of the left 2 columns that account for rotary encoder functions.

OLED graphics were converted from .pngs of application logos using [image2cpp](https://javl.github.io/image2cpp/)

The layouts for each layer are as follows (volume control on rotary for Blender layer, zoom for the other apps):

1. Layer 0: Blender (basically a numpad)
2. Layer 1: Adobe Illustrator
3. Layer 2: Procreate
